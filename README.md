## Author Notes

>**IMPORTANT**: *These warnings no longer apply as of commits made 11/15.*

[**~~Deprecated~~**]

- **Smartest Snapshot of ChatGPT**: This application uses the latest GPT-4 model with vision capabilities. However, users can and perhaps should switch to the standard `gpt-4` model and adjust token limits (default is 4000) for different use cases.
  - The Model Parameters, including the model itself, can be found on/around Line 200 in `server.js`, and has multiple comments to guide you if you're just getting started with customizing the API Responses.
  - Be aware that although the API returns will be objectively better than what you receive on ChatGPT, usage adds up, and you may soon run out of credits.
  - Always keep track of your token usage (relevant link found below), and adjust instructions and/or parameters when needed.
- **Voice Chat**: Calls to OpenAI's proprietary *multi-modal APIs* via your key; be sure to keep an eye on your *expenses*.
- **Billing for API Use**: A $5 deposit is required to access the *paid tier* of the OpenAI API. See OpenAI *Documentation* for billing setup.
- **Understanding GPT Parameters**: The *Basics*
  - **Temperature**: Controls randomness. Lower values make responses more predictable.
  - **Max Tokens**: Determines the length of each completion.
  - **Other Parameters**: Explore prompt engineering and comments for custom behaviors.
- **API Chat Completions**: Tailor chat completions to your specific use case.
- **Session Management**: Each page reload starts a new session. Session history isn't preserved.
- **Custom Instructions**: Found in `instructions.md`. Modify user profile and instructions as needed. These are optimized for GPT-4 based on extensive research.
- For *security reasons*, this *web portal* requires the user to do some work of their own: *installing* the necessary dependencies and packages, adding their own *environment variables* like *API Key* and *HTTP Auth Credentials* (you can simply make these up) in a `.env` file, and manually running the *server* in your terminal.
  - Be assured that this repo is incapable of grabbing any information from the User, including their Key, but they should still be careful when experimenting with *Pull Requests*, regardless of the `.gitignore` file in the root of this repository.

### Further Explanations

The OpenAI **API**, or *Application Programming Interface*, directly sends **HTTP** requests to the unsanitized and original *GPT-4 model*, and lets you customize certain weights of the modelâ€™s responses, like randomness or "temperature", and length or "tokens". You'll need to monitor your usage of the more expensive but intelligent **GPT-4** model, which will cost just over *10-20 Cents* per session, and needs you to add *Five Dollars* in credit to be able to use your **API Key**.

Be aware that at base usage of this web application, you send roughly 1000 tokens for one message to GPT-4, or three cents, and another six cents will be used when it responds with over 1000 words. This is due to the information *concatenated* to the **System Prompt** in the *Custom Instructions*. This file will be sent in the **Conversation History** with each request.

Model behavior will be primarily influenced by whatever *context* is first provided to the API; it lacks a severe filter compared to ChatGPT with increased **steerability**, but is more *expensive* than the regular Chat Interface and will *restrict* you from sending messages once you are **rate-limited**.

- Consult the provided links and **documentation** for more guidance on *Setup* and *Prompting*.
- Users are encouraged to modify the **User Profile** in `instructions.md`, which can be found in the `public` directory, as well as the model name via `server.js`, found in the root of **GPTPortal**.
- More information will be added about *Model Behavior* and *API Usage* to the **ReadMe** in the future.

**IMPORTANT Note** : For the **Voice Functionality** *Feature*, due to *WebKit's*'s lack of codec support and firewalling, *Whisper* and *TTS* will **NOT** work on the **Safari** *Browser*; you will need to switch to Chrome (or any other Chromium fork, including Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.) or Firefox if you want to use the *Voice Chat*.

If you'd like to add Apple-Support to *MediaRecording* via *JavaScript* feel free to install the [RecordRTC](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC) GitHub repo and fork this project, as according to *Stack Overflow* and *Apple Community*, that should fix the issue, but I don't want this repository to get bloated.

- If you know of a better way, feel free to submit a **Pull Request**!
- The Relevant *Stack Overflow* Links are in this [*Arc Folder*](https://arc.net/space/04350A44-1A64-49DD-8196-FEA54DF31BDF).

Lastly, if you have uploaded an image and are working with the Vision model, you may no longer switch models mid-conversation, as it will be unable to parse the content of the image in the conversation history. It is best to export the conversation and continue it separately.

### Guide: Basic Setup & Use

#### 1. **Understanding the Basics**

- **GitHub**: A platform for *hosting and sharing code*. Think of it as a library of code projects.
- **Node.js**: An *open-source*, cross-platform *JavaScript* runtime environment. It's like the *engine* that will run the chatbot on your computer.
- **API Key**: A *unique identifier* used to authenticate requests to OpenAI's services.

#### 2. **Setting Up the Environment**

- **Create a GitHub Account**: Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account.
- **Install Git**: Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
  - *Git* is a tool that allows you to download and manage code from GitHub.
- **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install **npm** (*Node Package Manager*), which is used to manage JavaScript packages.

#### 3. **Cloning the Repository**

- **Clone via Git**:
- On a Mac, open '*Terminal*'; on *Windows*, open '*Command Prompt*'. These programs allow you to interact with your computer using text commands.
- Type `git clone https://github.com/Zaki-1052/GPTPortal.git` and press Enter. This command copies the ChatBot Portal code from GitHub to your computer.
- **Navigate to the Directory**:
- In the same window, type `cd GPTPortal` and press Enter. This moves you into the folder where the ChatBot Portal code is stored.
  - Be aware that in order to run the server for this repo, you will need to be in the root directory in your terminal. This means that if you rename and place it elsewhere (your Desktop, for example), you will need to `cd ~/Desktop/GPTPortal`, and use its new name before running.

#### 4. **Setting Up the ChatBot Portal**

- **Install Dependencies**:
- Still in Terminal or Command Prompt, ensure you're in the `GPTPortal` directory. Now, type `npm install` and press Enter. This installs additional code packages that the ChatBot Portal needs to function.
- **Configuration**:
- Find the `.env.example` file in the `GPTPortal` folder. Rename it to `.env`. This is where you'll put sensitive settings, like your OpenAI key.
- Open this `.env` file in a text editor and follow the format shown in the file to fill in your **OpenAI API Key** and **Login Credentials** (*Username and Password*).
  - Be sure to fill out the **HTTP Authentication** shown in the environment example as well, where you can simply make up your credentials for signing into the port. This information cannot be accessed over the internet and runs locally on your machine.

#### 5. **Obtaining an OpenAI API Key**

- **Sign Up for OpenAI**:
- Visit [OpenAI's Website](https://openai.com/) and create an account.
- **API Key Generation**:
- Once you're logged in, find the API section (linked below in *Relevant Links*) and generate a new API key. This key is like a password that lets your ChatBot Portal access OpenAI's features.
- **Insert API Key**:
- Copy the generated API key and paste it into your `.env` file in the place of `your_api_key_here`.
  - Never share your key with anyone. This is what is used to pay for the API. Their billing system is explained in the Relevant Links, but basically, you pay out of your API Credit Balance for what you actually use, and it carries over from month to month. Refer to your personal usage page for more information. Your API is private and cannot be accessed by anyone online unless you post it.

#### 6. **Running the ChatBot Portal**

- **Start the Application**:
  - Go back to *Terminal* or *Command Prompt*. Make sure you're in the `GPTPortal` directory and type `node server.js`, then press Enter. This starts the ChatBot Portal on your computer.
- **Accessing the Portal**:
- Open a web browser and type `http://localhost:3000/portal` in the address bar. Press Enter to access the ChatBot Portal.
  - You will need to sign in with the "**Username**" and "**Password**" that you chose. If you simply copied or renamed the example template, the default settings are eponymously named.

#### 7. **Basic Troubleshooting**

- **Common Issues**:
- If the ChatBot doesn't start, check if you missed any steps like installing Node.js, running `npm install`, or correctly entering your API key in the `.env` file.
- **Consult README**:
- The README file in the `GPTPortal` directory has more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips. Refer to it if you encounter issues or need more information.

### Updates

![Updated Portal View](showcase.png)

This **Updates** Section will showcase any further features added to the repository.

- **IMPORTANT UPDATE**: A *Model Selector* has now been added.
  - This means that you will no longer need to adjust this parameter in `server.js`.

#### Token Costs Explained

In terms of API calls, they can certainly add up if you're running heavy sessions with GPT-4: the most intelligent (and expensive!) model. For now, this section will serve as a placeholder until I add full support for tracking your token and billing credit usage; I'll also explain mathematically how you can best budget your use of these models in order to get the best possible experience!

##### Understanding the Costs and Usage Pattern

1. **Base Cost**: Each API call has a base cost of 3 cents for the system prompt (at default).
2. **Token Costs**:
   - Additional 1000 tokens in request: 3 cents.
   - Each 1000 tokens in response: 6 cents.
   - Audio adds a couple more cents (depending on length).
3. **Context Accumulation**: Using previous messages in the API request, which cumulatively increases token count.
4. **Spending**:
   - Imagine a Monthly Budget: $10.

##### Session Cost Breakdown

###### Cost Components

1. **Base Cost**: 3 cents for the system prompt (fixed 1k tokens).
2. **Input Cost**: 3 cents per 1000 tokens.
3. **Output Cost**: 6 cents per 1000 tokens.

   **Total for Initial Request**: 3 (base) + 3 (input) + 6 (output) = 12 cents.

###### Second Request

Now, let's say for the second request, you include the initial request and response as part of the input, which cumulatively increases the token count.

1. **Previous Input + Output**: 3000 tokens (2000 Input (1k System + 1k Query) + 1000 Output from the first request).
2. **New Input**: Let's assume 1000 tokens.
3. **Total Input #2**: 3000 (previous) + 1000 (new) = 4000 tokens â‰ˆ 12 cents.
4. **Output Tokens #2**: Let's assume another 1000 tokens (6 cents).
   **Total for Second Request**: 12 (input) + 6 (output) = 18 cents.

###### Cumulative Session Cost

- **First Request**: 12 cents.
- **Second Request**: 18 cents.

   **Total Session Cost**: 12 + 18 = 30 cents.

##### Key Considerations

- **Cumulative Input**: Each subsequent request will have a larger input size due to the inclusion of previous inputs and outputs.
- **Managing Token Count**: Being strategic about the number of tokens used in each request and response can help manage costs. This includes frontloading requests with tokens or limiting the scope of each request to manage the token count.
- **Output Control**: While you have more control over the input size, the output size can vary. Planning for the maximum possible output cost in each session helps in staying within the budget.
  - These can be managed in the "*parameters*" section on `server.js` (read the comments)
- **Final Thoughts**: By understanding how the costs accumulate and the impact of including previous inputs and outputs in new requests, you can more accurately predict and manage your session costs. This step-by-step breakdown should help in visualizing how each component contributes to the total cost.

##### Monthly Budget Analysis

1. **Total Monthly Budget**: $10 (1000 cents).
2. **Daily Session Cost**: 30 cents.
3. **Monthly Session Projection**:
   - Every day for a month: 30 cents x 30 days = $9 (900 cents), which is under budget.
   - Every other day for a month: 30 cents x 15 days = $4.50 (450 cents).
     - If token use is restrained, you could have a budget of $5 per month.
     - This means that you could only use two (longer) messages in a session by alternating days.

##### Further Token Use

- If a heavier final output is needed (2000 tokens), you will reach the "*Max Tokens"* set in the parameters. While the context length of the model is 8000 tokens, 6000 is set manually here for safety.
  - This will mean an additional cost of 6 cents for 36 cents, and still need "chunking" of messages.
  - Please read OpenAI's linked *Prompt Engineering* Documentation if you expect to modify this.
- If you do expect to modify the *parameters* to use more tokens, expect that your API credit use will increase exponentially.
      - Example: A third request will mean an additional **15 cents** of input, and an output of up to an additional **20 cents** depending on the size of the response.
       - This would then total up to **70 cents** per session if audio or images are included.
       - Expect to budget the same amount as you are paying for **ChatGPT** if you are utilizing the API so heavily (*$20/month*).

#### TODOs

- [x] Add Token Cost Explanation and Tracking
- [x] Update API Call for Vision to Default Model
- [x] Add Model Selector
- [x] Make Updated Video Showcase
- [x] Added Export Functionality
